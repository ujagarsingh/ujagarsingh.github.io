## Tell me something about yourself in brief.
“I’m a UI Developer with 8+ years’ of experience that I have gained across multiple IT Companies. Currenty I am working in SAG Infotech. In my current job role, I am responsible for UI Design with responsive Web Layout. On a daily basis, I handle a 4-member team of UI Developer and Junior HTML Designer. Besides being a UI Developer, I am a fair and independent individual. I try not to be judgmental and always absorb constructive criticism, listen to my project manager' inputs, our client's complaints as well as address my team members' issues, to my best possible abilities.”

## What are your strengths and weaknesses?
“I am committed, honest and self-motivated. I forgive easily and hate to keep grudges in my heart. My greatest weakness is that I trust people very easily.”

## You have changed jobs/jumped ship too many times already, why so?
“I have the requisite skills to make your risk worth it. Chatting less and letting my work do the talking, is my motto. In the past, whatever project and work was assigned to me was delivered on time and also at par with all the quality standards.”

## What are your strong points? or What are your strengths?
“I am passionate towards my work and also a good listener, which means, I take my instructions seriously. I am not a person who leaves things midway. I never lose focus, even if I am under stress or have stringent deadlines to meet. I like to finish every single task on my to-do list completely. Optimism, energy and my ability to learn quickly let me hit the ground and rapidly solve problems. I also have good communication skills which means I can deal fairly well with my business clients as well as with the members of my internal team, in the future. Based on my skills, abilities, and experience, I know I would be a great addition to the team.”

## What is your greatest fear?
“I work too hard sometimes and care too much about my work. I am a fast learner and very open minded. I assure that I do not carry any pre-conceived notions regarding how I feel I should perform my job.”

## If I call up your current or previous reporting manager now, what will be their opinion about you? What will they say that you need to work on?
“Interesting. During my last performance review, my project manager did not list any areas of improvement and gave me an outstanding rating. However, if I were to think of one, I would guess that I need to speak up more during meetings. I always have good ideas and contribute my thoughts to my current project. But I discuss these ideas with my project manager and let him do all the talking during meetings.”

## Do you have any serious medical issues?
“I do not have any serious medical issues.”

## What do your friends/co-workers say about you?
“Since I like to build strong professional relationships with my teammates, most of them have become great friends. We have been spending eight hours a day, five days a week for several years now. So, I am sure that whatever they say, will be realistic and not made up. One thing that they will surely mention about me is my love for reading about new technologies! The rest is up to you to find out.”

## What is the difference between hard work and smart work?
“Hard work is delivering work on time with more effort and smart work is delivering work on time, with lesser effort. I feel that is the basic difference. Most of the times, in the corporate world, I feel a combination of both is needed to attain excellence.”

## How quickly do you adapt to new technology?
“I can adapt quickly to new circumstances. Since I am clear about my job role and I am mentally prepared to take up challenges, I feel I have the capacity to learn fast and apply my new knowledge. During my working life, I had to complete all assignments and projects whatever give me by my Project Manager or Team Leader and thoroughly enjoyed doing it. Similarly, I will enjoy picking up new technologies in my professional life as well.”

## What did you do in the last year to improve your knowledge?

## What motivates you?
“Meeting the set target within an assigned deadline motivates me the most. When I do so, I get a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. When this is coupled with an award, I feel all the more motivated. All in all, I like to achieve milestones, so that I can look back at them and say to myself, ‘Yes, that was my achievement.’ Visible results also motivate me.”

## What are your hobbies? or What are you passionate about?
“I have many hobbies such as reading books, farming etc but the hobby which i like to perform the most is spending my time with family. I have a joint family. We all sit together in the hall and talk about our life. We laugh a lot and our parents share their own experiences. We all enjoy this a lot . By this we all share our personal problems with any family member and share our burden. I feel everything nice when i sit in my family. We all eat dinner together. But as their is a saying that a sinner would only get releve when he shares his sin with someone. So all of us must sit in our family for some time even in one week."
